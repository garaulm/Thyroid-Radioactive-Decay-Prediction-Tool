## Overview
ThyRAD is a web-based tool designed to predict radioactive iodine (¬π¬≥¬πI) decay in patients treated for differentiated thyroid carcinoma.  
Main features:  
- Calculate decay constants (Œª) and half-life (t¬Ω)  
- Generate decay tables and time-activity curves  
- Estimate when a patient‚Äôs radiation exposure drops below a threshold (¬µSv/h). 
- Compute the area under the curve (AUC)  
(Further modules will be added).
